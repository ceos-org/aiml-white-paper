## 4.8. GISTDA

The Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) is utilizing AI/ML across various fields in Thailand’s Earth observation ecosystem and geospatial intelligence missions. GISTDA’s long-term vision is to leverage AI/ML for space data analysis through the evidence-based Geointelligence LLM platform, in order to support effective decision-making, promote sustainable development, and provide insights to inform national policymaking. Recognizing the importance of AI/ML technology, a five-year AI/ML development roadmap has currently been drafted for GISTDA’s key missions, emphasizing resilience, innovation, and responsiveness to societal needs, as shown in the image below.

**AI4EO Examples**

**AI for Air Quality and Well-being**  
To support public health awareness and helps citizens make informed decisions to prepare for or respond to pollution, GISTDA developed [Check Phoon](https://pm25.gistda.or.th/), a mobile and web-based application for monitoring PM2.5 at sub-district level resolution. The system integrates in-situ measurements from Thailand’s Pollution Control Department (PCD) with meteorological and satellite data, and applying ML for forecasting 3-hour air quality predictions and accuracy reports.

**AI for Disaster Risk Reduction**  
Thailand is one of the countries that experience a lot of disaster due to the signature of South East Asia’s climate. To support both local authorities and regional cooperation, GISTDA operates the [Disaster Monitoring and Decision Support Platform](https://disaster.gistda.or.th/landing), This platform integrating flood, wildfire, and drought models at sub-district level resolution. The three models are under development to incorporate AI-driven flood risk forecasting, wildfire spreading prediction, and drought risk analysis.

**AI for Image Quality and Enhancement**  
Collaborating with Nara Space, GISTDA applies AI-based Super-Resolution technique to THEOS-2 imagery to enhances spatial resolution from 0.5 m to 0.25 m. This processing addresses information gaps by training unpaired datasets across different satellites. This work expands the usability of very-high-resolution imagery for applications such as urban planning, agriculture, national security, and also escalate the chances to combining other AI/ML technique to the analysis such as image detection.

**GeoAgentic AI-LLM Prototype for Urban Governance**  
GISTDA and National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)plan to developing a prototype Digital Twin platform that combines AI/LLM with geospatial data to address urban challenges such as the Urban Heat Island effect then provide actionable policy recommendations. This project aims to contribute to Thailand’s preparedness for climate change and sustainable urban development.

**Impact and Future Directions**  
Through these initiatives, GISTDA is strengthening its foundation in AI and ML for Earth observation and geospatial applications. The continued integration of these technologies will enhance Thailand’s capacity in environmental monitoring, disaster resilience, and space technology development. Looking forward, GISTDA aims to expand its AI/ML capabilities through international collaboration and knowledge exchange under CEOS and GEO frameworks. These efforts reflect GISTDA’s commitment to advancing responsible, explainable, and impactful AI applications that contribute to global sustainability and equitable access to Earth observation benefits.

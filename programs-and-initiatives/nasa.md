## 4.3. NASA

**Overview**

National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Earth Science Division has multiple organisations advancing AI/ML, each contributing to five overarching goals described in  Figure 4.3-1. Division-level strategies guide investments to maximise impact and avoid duplication of effort.

NASA’s [High-End Computing (HEC) program](https://hec.nasa.gov/) has made investments in AI-specific platforms. These platforms include HPC and cloud assets with the latest hardware accelerators and AI specific processors and libraries. The Research & Analysis program supports targeted AI activities, some of which have been realized  through competitive solicitations. Currently, most of their focus has been around modeling and assimilation. 

EOSDIS houses over 100 Petabytes of earth science data in the cloud and is working on ways to make that data easily available to ML practitioners in an Analysis-Ready, Cloud-optimized (ARCO) manner. Improving cloud-based earth science data’s interoperability with ML managed services from major cloud providers is also a high priority for EOSDIS.

These goals address the entire data lifecycle process, including collaborations and building AI capacity and expertise within the program. The data systems program has a number of activities related to AI aligning with NASA’s strategic goals – that includes;

* competitive program and partnership activities  
* augmenting data stewardship tasks such as search and discovery  
* maximizing the use of data. 

ESDS also fosters AI/ML research through NASA's Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth System Science ([ACCESS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/access)) program. This competitive program develops and implements technologies to effectively manage, discover, and utilize NASA's archive of Earth observations for scientific research and applications in support of NASA Earth science research goals. The following are the most recent ACCESS projects utilizing AI:

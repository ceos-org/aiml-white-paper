## 4.5. ISRO

**Overview**

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has increasingly incorporated AI/ML in various facets of Earth observation data processing, marking a transformative shift in data processing technology. AI is playing a pivotal role in automating and enhancing the efficiency of data analysis, enabling ISRO to glean valuable insights from the vast amounts of information gathered by Earth observation satellites. 

**AI4EO Examples**

ISRO’s work in the field of AI can be categorized in three broad domains \- data acquisition related processing, data processing/fusion/augmentation and information extraction. Some key representative tasks in each category, that are being addressed through the use of AI, are shown in Figure 4.5-1. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, are being utilized to surpass the classical approaches in each of these domains to improve the overall impact of the Earth observation data collected and processed at ISRO.

In the data acquisition related AI processing, the emphasis is on improving the quality of the data which is obtained from various spaceborne/airborne sensors.  Various models developed in this area include data reconstruction, image restoration, thermal resolution improvement as well as models related to compression/decompression of the high-resolution data. 

The second category is for the data processing and augmentation research projects that are focusing on using data from multiple-sources (multimodal, multi-temporal or multi-sensor) to generate enhanced value products through the use of AI. This includes tasks such as spatial or spectral super-resolution, data fusion, image-to-image translation and generation of various types of AI-ready data for downstream tasks. 

The final category of AI related tasks is the information extraction category. The primary objective here is to derive information such as resource maps, land-use land cover classification, specific object detection, content aware image search, as well as onboard intelligence applications. Some of the methods are targeting the time-series and change detection applications. Many models have been built in this category, e.g. cloud-detection, forest-fire detection, solar rooftop potential estimation, building footprint extraction, etc. 

The work related to this aspect is integrated via research and development related to core topics in AI such as development of new models for specific applications, adaptation of cutting edge research for specific use cases, implementation of infrastructure for supporting development and deployment of AI applications, and core AI research such as explainable AI. Work is also being done to integrate and harness the potential of vast amounts of data available from ISRO’s fleet of remote sensing sensors. 

ISRO is also working towards a common framework, where the work related to AI that is taking place across different teams and projects can be synergized. In this direction, some standards have been studied and are planned to be implemented in near future. Some of these models are now being integrated into publicly available web-platforms.

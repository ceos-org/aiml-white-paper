## 4.4. NOAA

**Overview**

**National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration** has a long history using AI/ML to support its mission areas, such as deep-sea exploration, habitat characterization, fishery species assessments, environmental modeling, and interpretation of Earth observation data. In 2021, NOAA released its first AI Strategy with five goals:

1. Establish an efficient organizational structure and processes to advance AI across NOAA.  
2. Advance AI research and innovation in support of NOAA’s mission.  
3. Accelerate the transition of AI research to applications.   
4. Strengthen and expand AI partnerships.   
5. Promote AI proficiency in the workforce.   

To achieve these goals, NOAA created a five-year strategic plan with a more coordinated approach across NOAA to embrace AI in support of NOAA’s mission areas through effectively developing the AI-ready data and tools for reliable and efficient processing, interpretation, and utilization of Earth observations.

**AI4EO examples**

Working with scientific fields and offices, NOAA has established the NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence ([NCAI](https://www.noaa.gov/ai)) to support new and ongoing projects and to propel innovative uses of responsible AI technology to support environmental equity, knowledge, and study.

Since its inception, NCAI has been focused on developing a focal point for NOAA to facilitate the advancement of AI-ready data and workforce development. NCAI is leading the development of community-driven data standards for AI-ready open environmental data through the collaboration with Earth Science Information Partners. The collaboration produced the first AI-readiness checklist for open environmental data ([https://github.com/esipfed/data-readiness](https://github.com/esipfed/data-readiness)) that are currently being used or plan to be used by NOAA, UK Met Office, World Data Systems, and other geoscience data repositories to conduct assessments of the readiness of environmental data including earth observations for AI development.

At its current stage, the AI-readiness assessment requires data experts to go through the published checklist manually which is difficult to be scaled to more than 60 PBs of environmental datasets at NOAA. Thus, NOAA is investing in a prototype tool using a natural language processing method to automate the AI-readiness assessment process and recommend improvements to existing NOAA datasets for AI development.

NOAA has invested in the improvement of selected datasets for AI applications, such as, [Tropical Cyclone PRecipitation, Infrared, Microwave, and Environmental Dataset (TC PRIMED)](https://rammb-data.cira.colostate.edu/tcprimed/), [NOAA Climate Data Records,](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/climate-data-records) and [water column sonar data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/water-column-sonar-data). 

Additionally, NOAA is actively seeking public-private partnership to enhance the usability of earth observation data for high-impact AI applications including AI for numerical weather prediction. One specific example is the collaboration between the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory and Brigntband to transform the archive of a diverse set of quality-controlled satellite observations to cloud-native data format to support data assimilation (https://techpartnerships.noaa.gov/tpo\_partnership/making-observation-data-ai-ready/). The resulting dataset – NOAA-NASA Joint Archive AI-ready data (NNJA-AI) – is made publicly available via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination program on Google Cloud.

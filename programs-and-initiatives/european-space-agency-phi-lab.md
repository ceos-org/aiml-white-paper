## 4.6. European Space Agency φ-lab

**Overview**   
The ESA Φ-lab is the ESA Earth Observation innovation laboratory that aims to accelerate the future of Earth Observation (EO) via transformative innovation and commercialisation actions, thereby strengthening Europe’s global competitiveness. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a core focus areas for the ESA Φ-lab, as it offers unprecedented capabilities to extract actionable insights from vast amounts of EO data,  enabling novel applications and business models. The ESA Φ-lab covers the whole spectrum of AI development, from ideation to generating tangible impacts in science, technology, or commercial field through its two offices: the **Explore Office** and the **Invest Office**. Additionally, the ESA Φ-lab also engages  at different levels with the development of about 20 satellites, ranging from technology demonstrators to operational or commercial missions, the vast majority of which are AI-powered as shown in the image below.

The [Explore Office](https://philab.esa.int/explore/) conducts R\&D activities on AI for EO by using a *user-driven* approach in exploring the technology from ideation to proof of concept. The office explore technologies and transformative ideas, prove their benefits, builds capacities from validated ideas and finally prepare the impact and uptake by end user. The office also spend a significant effort in growing a large community around Φ-lab. In doing this, the Explore Office mainly works on 3 technological pillars:

1. Innovative computing paradigms  
2. Trustable Augmented Intelligence  
3. ICT revolution

The [Invest Office](https://philab.esa.int/invest/) promotes commercial initiatives through the [InCubed](https://incubed.esa.int/) (Investing in Industrial Innovation) program. InCubed is a Public Private Partnership co-funding program run by the ESA Φ-lab Invest Office, focusing on developing innovative and commercially viable products and services that exploit the value of EO imagery and datasets. The program's broad scope supports everything from building satellites to developing new EO business models. Today, the majority of proposals for downstream activities are AI-related and focus on agriculture, forestry, emergency response, insurance, maritime, carbon monitoring, and asset management and identification. Instead, for upstream activities, it is trendy to bring AI-processing capabilities at-the-edge to address the data downlink bottleneck and reduce data latency for value maximisation. The InCubed programme size is about 225m€ and has 140 activities in the pipeline with about 10 satellite constellations under development.

**AI4EO Examples** 

R\&D activities conducted by the Φ-lab Explore focus on key AI-related technologies and explore their potential for various EO use cases. In particular, the main topics of interest involve:

* *Innovative computing paradigms:* the Φ-lab Explore Office combines AI-related research to the investigation of alternative computing paradigms that could further enhance benefits introduced by AI for specific use cases. Alternative computing paradigms involve:  
  * **Edge Computing:** when moved on board EO satellites, AI could enable the detection of actionable information that could significantly reduce the latency for EO use cases having near-real-time requirements (e.g., civil security applications, operational services for natural disasters management). In addition, it could enable novel acquisition systems. \[[143](/reference.md#ref.143), [144](/reference.md#ref.144)\]. Onboard AI is a central element in the scope of [Φ-Sat-1](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Ph-sat), [Φsat-2](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Phsat-2/Introducing_Phsat-2) missions, to which the Φ-lab Explore Office has provided a pivotal contribution.  
  * **Neuromorphic computing:** neuromorphic computing is a brain-inspired asynchronous, event-based, and massively parallel computing paradigm. Among various neuromorphic computing techniques, spiking neural networks have attracted the interest of researchers for their potential energy efficiency, which makes it promising for onboard satellite implementations.  
  * **Quantum Machine Learning:** when combined with quantum computing algorithms, ML could further enhance its capability to process intricate data structures and very large volumes of data. The Φ-lab Explore Office is investigating the potential of quantum and hybrid implementations of ML algorithms for EO use cases\[[145](/reference.md#ref.145)\]  
* *Trustable Augmented Intelligence:* this topic investigates numerous AI branches to augment the capabilities to extract actionable and trusthworthy insights from EO data and take informed decisions. The main AI branches under investigation include:  
  * **Explainable AI:** the goal of explainable AI is to provide transparent and/or interpreatable models for various EO use cases.  
  * **Physics-informed Machine Learning:** physics-informed ML incorporates physics principles into the training process with potential advantages in terms of data efficiency, computational intensity, and robustness to noisy data.  
  * **Foundation models:** Given the scarcity of labeled EO data, foundation models—large-scale models trained on extensive datasets—have the potential to surpass specialized application models while requiring significantly fewer labeled examples. A key contribution from the Φ-lab Explore Office is the creation of the [PhilEO Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04464), a benchmark designed for rigourous evaluation of foundation models for EO applications. Research on foundation models is often coupled with the investigation of *self-supervised learning*, which aims to train Machine Learning (ML) models in an unsupervised manner.  
  * **Generative AI:** generative AI has various applications in Earth Observation, including spatial resolution of EO data and automatic generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.  
  * **Digital assistant for EO:** Large Language Models could be used to create an assistant to facilitate the processing and the interaction with EO data by using natural language\[[146](/reference.md#ref.146)\].  
* *User-driven* approach: plethora of R\&D activities in AI for EO characterized by an application-centric methodology, which scrutinizes AI's potential for specific, socially impactful use cases, for example:  
  *   
  * **AI for health:** by using ensemble of ML models to process satellite data, it is possible to predict [dengue fever outbreaks](https://philab.esa.int/%CF%86-lab-and-unicef-joint-dengue-fever-research-receives-further-award/).  
  * **AI for Earth Science:** AI is providing a significant contribution to numerous fields of Earth Science. The Φ-lab Explore Office has investigated the potential of AI for weather modelling, solar forecasting, and other related applications.  
  * **AI for Green and sustainable future:** in the face of escalating climate changes, the urgency for efficient forecasting and response systems for natural disasters has never been greater. AI can play a critical role in processing and fusing in-situ with satellite data for high spatial and temporal resolution forecasting of [global storm surges](https://philab.esa.int/global-storm-surge-forecasting-creating-early-warning-models-with-ai4eo/).  
  * **AI for Destination Earth:** [Destination Earth](https://philab.esa.int/flagship-programmes/destination-earth/) (DestinE) is a European Commission initiative to develop an ambitious AI-driven decision-support system based on a very high accurate digital model of the Earth. This system aims to monitor and simulate natural and human activity, along with developing and validating policy scenarios. ESA participates in the initiative by leading the overall effort in collaboration with EUMETSAT and ECMWF. ESA Member States have initiated a companion programme, the ESA Digital Twin Earth (DTE), to foster the exploitation of DestinE data for Earth observation and innovation. Φ-lab actively supports the activities of DestinE and ESA DTE to bring the demonstrated analysis and reasoning capabilities of AI technologies to the heart of the operations, along with stimulating further exploitation by various user communities. DestinE will use unprecedented observation and simulation products, powered by Europe’s HPC computers and AI power, to push the limits of computing, forecasting, planning, and acting.

In pursuit of these goals, Φ-lab Explore Office extensively on activities aiming at community engagement, dissemination and partnership creation with academic and industrial partners, international organizations, and other ESA divisions. To foster research and use of AI for EO use cases, the Φ-lab Explore Office has contributed to the release of: numerous *datasets* (e.g., [WorldStrat](https://worldstrat.github.io/), [Seeing Beyond the Visible](https://platform.ai4eo.eu/seeing-beyond-the-visible/data), [Major TOM](https://philab.esa.int/hello-major-tom-esa-%CF%86-lab-releases-largest-ml-ready-sentinel-2-dataset-ever-published/), [THRawS](https://zenodo.org/records/7908728), [VSD2Raw](https://zenodo.org/records/7982468), and [DENETHOR](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uUa4jNMLjrL)) and toolboxes (please consult [ESA-PhiLab GitHub](https://github.com/ESA-PhiLab)).

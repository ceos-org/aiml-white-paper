| Active (sensor) | A sensor—like lidar, SAR—that emits its own EM pulses and perceives the properties of remote objects as alterations in the backscatter. See also, passive. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Aerial** (sensor) | An airborne sensor; on board an aircraft. |
| **Aerosol** | Microscopic solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere. |
| **Amplitude** | A wave property that signifies the absolute range in which the wave oscillates. |
| **Annotation** | Another term for **ground truth** and **labels**. They can be used interchangeably. |
| **Architecture** (DL) | The design of a **deep learning** model, specifying how all the **layers** in the neural net connect. Due to their modular nature, rarely do two DL models share the same architecture, but they all fall under one of few types. **Convolution** works well in images; **recurrence** works well in **sequential** data. |
| **Backscatter** | An **EM** wave backscatters when its reflection travels back the same direction it came from. |
| **Band** (spectral)  | An interval in the **EM** wavelength spectrum, within which a sensor measures the intensity of light received at such wavelengths. |
| **Classification** | An ML task in which an input is assigned one of many categorical variables, such as detecting the presence of a ship in a satellite image. |
| **Coherence**  | A measure of alignment between the phases of all waves in a light pulse; useful for measuring the flatness of a surface. |
| **Convolution** (layer) | A neural net **layer** found in **CNN** **architectures**, whose output does not change when the input signal is shifted. For example, a convolutional layer trained on building footprints activating when a building is present anywhere in the input image. |
| **Deep learning** | A modular approach to ML with **neural nets** that contain many **layers**. Deep neural nets can learn complex features automatically from data, thus minimising the need for humans to engineer features based on intuition. For this reason **DL** is also known as *representation learning*, in the sense that deep nets form their own internal bank of features that best solve the task at hand. DL works best with at least thousands of datapoints available, and the use of larger models (in terms of **layers** and **parameters**) makes sense when more data is available. However, their modelling power comes at the cost of interpretability. |
| **Diffuse reflection** | A reflected EM wave that travels in a direction different to that of **backscatter**. |
| **Earth observation** | The combination of remote and in-situ based sensing for the Earth. |
| **Feature** (ML) | The part of a ML model that numerically represents a certain pattern in the data. Features can be engineered by a human based on their domain expertise and intuition. A classic example is **NDVI**—a vegetation index commonly used in **optical** imagery. In **neural nets**, features can be learned automatically from data, and can be found in the output of a **layer** or the input of the layer after it. |
| **Frequency** | The number of oscillations per second (in Hz units); useful for measuring the energy stored in a light wave and therefore determining the chemical composition of the material from which it was emitted—like water, soil, and vegetation. |
| **Generative** (model) | A type of ML model that attempts to characterise how the observed data are generated. If successful, the model can generate novel instances of similar data, like rivers that do not actually exist. |
| **Ground sensor** | A sensor installed on the ground. |
| **Ground truth**  (data) | The part of the dataset that is compared against the predictions of a ML model to assess its predictive ability. Typically such data are provided by human annotators and subject matter experts. Not to be confused with **ground**\-based data. |
| **Hyperspectral** | Similar to **multispectral** imagery, but each pixel is described by tens or hundreds of **bands**. |
| **Ill-posed / ill-conditioned** | A characterization of mathematical problems referring to their difficulty due to not having enough input data to constrain the space of solutions to a useful degree. All ML problems are inherently ill-posed because they involve the inference of unknown quantities (locations, pixel values, etc) from noisy data. Such quantities cannot be verified with complete certainty, otherwise ML would not be required. |
| **Image translation** | A type of ML task that changes the properties and look of an image. This can be a low-level change of the signal properties, like a radiometric calibration for harmonising two sensors; or a higher level change of the image semantics, like cloud removal. |
| **In situ** (data) | The opposite of remotely sensed data, when a sensor is physically connected to the observed object. In continual monitoring, a sensor might be transmitting measurements in real-time, like the water-level at a perennial (always flowing) part of a river; or the soil moisture in the middle of an agricultural field. Non-real time in-situ data come from occasional or regular ground surveys. |
| **Interferometry** | The use of overlapping EM waves and the interference between them, as a way to measure properties of remote objects, like distance or movement. |
| **Labels** (data) | Another term for **ground truth** and **annotations**. They can be used interchangeably. |
| **Land cover** (data) | Land classification scheme with respect to the surface physical material. Examples: water,  wetland, forest, grassland, shrubland, barren land, farmland, tundra, snow / ice. |
| **Land use** (data) | Land classification scheme with respect to human use, e.g. agricultural, urban, industrial. |
| **Laser** | Light in which all pulses are synced in phase (**coherent**). |
| **Layer** (DL) | A module of a neural network which applies many **linear** functions independently to its input, each with a separate output. Also, a nonlinear function is often applied to further constrain the outputs to a desired range of values, like from 0 to 1, or to non-negative values. |
| **Learning** (ML) | The fitting of a statistical model’s parameters to data, by means of a mathematical *criterion* that a) specifies the learned task, like precipitation forecasting; and b) instruments the progress of learning, like the error between the forecasted and **ground-truth** values. For example: A regressor that forecasts precipitation, and a classifier that indicates flooding, are both fit by minimising a discrepancy between their predictions and the **ground-truth** target values. |
| **Light** | Colloquially referring to electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths. These include (from longer to shorter wavelengths): radio, microwaves, infrared, visible, UV, X rays, gamma rays. |
| **Linear function** | A mathematical function of the form y \= wᐧx \+ b that describes a linear relationship between x and y, with w and b as the slope and vertical offset of the line, respectively. Such functions are fast to compute (even faster on GPUs) and can be easily interpreted by humans. For this reason, linear functions form the basis of most ML models—from **linear regression** to **neural nets**. |
| **Linear regression** | A statistical model that **learns** a **linear function** to model the relationship of two quantities. The model **parameters** (w and b) are **learned** from data. However, linear functions are limited in the complexity of **features** that they can learn from data. Therefore, neural **layers** often further apply a nonlinear function to allow for more complex (non-linear) **features** to be learned by the model. |
| **Machine learning** | An approach to AI by learning correlations from data, and extrapolating them to new unseen data. Recent breakthroughs in ML are so often discussed as AI breakthroughs that the terms are seemingly synonymous. Strictly speaking, **ML** is a subfield of **AI**, but we use them interchangeably. |
| **Multispectral** | A type of **optical** data where each pixel has a reflectance value per **band**, typically for 3-12 bands. |
| **Neural net** | A modular composition of simple neural **layers** that together form more complex mathematical functions than that of a single neural layer. Large neural nets contain hundreds of layers, each with hundreds of features. As a result, modern deep learning models contain between several thousand to billions of **parameters**, depending on the application. |
| **Off-nadir angle** | The angle between the nadir (direction beneath the satellite) and the direction of view. |
| **Optical** (sensor) | A type of light sensor operating on the visible and near-visible part of the spectrum. |
| **Orbital** (sensor) | A satellite sensor, flying at an altitude ranging from hundreds (LEO) to thousands of km (MEO, GEO). |
| **Panchromatic** (band) | An interval in the **EM** spectrum encompassing all visible light wavelengths. Wider bands capture more light per unit area, so images in the **PAN** band come naturally in higher spatial resolution, usually by an order of magnitude. On the other hand, equally bright objects that look distinct in **RGB**, do not look distinct in PAN. In this sense, some material properties become harder to resolve in a PAN band.. |
| **Pansharpening** | An enhancement of **optical** products that combines the higher spatial resolution of a **PAN** band, with the higher spectral information of **RGB** bands. This results in pansharpened RGB bands. |
| **Parameter** (ML) | A degree of freedom in a statistical model, typically **learned** automatically from data. See also, **linear**. |
| **Passive** (sensor) | A sensor, typically **optical**, that detects **EM** pulses from external sources. See also, **active**. |
| **Phase** | A wave property that signifies the fraction of a full oscillation. As such, it can describe the relative shift between two waves in the direction of travel. |
| **Point cloud** (data) | A dataset of coordinates in 3D space, each recording the origin of a **backscattered** pulse. Knowing the speed of light, a high-precision clock can convert the return time to a distance at the meter scale. |
| **Polarisation** | The orientation of the oscillation plane of the wave with respect to an observer facing the direction of travel of the wave. One of many applications with SAR sensors is to infer tree density in a forest. |
| **Polarimetry** | The use of the **polarisation** of an EM wave to infer properties of the observed surface, such as structure, orientation and environmental conditions around the surface. |
| **Product** (data) | A compilation of digital signals generated by a sensor. The data product makes sense only in the context of its specification: the physical units of measure, pre-processing levels, metadata. |
| **Radar** | A type of sensor that uses radio waves to measure distances (ranging), angles, velocities of objects. |
| **Radiance** (spectral) | The power (energy per second) per unit area per unit frequency of an EM wave. |
| **Recurrent** (layer) | A neural net **layer** found in **RNN** **architectures**, whose output is fed back to its input for many timesteps, and that allows them to retain a memory of common patterns in the sequential data. For example, a recurrent layer trained on crop yield time-series activating at the end of a harvest cycle. |
| **Remote sensing** | The engineering field of **sensors**, their data processing, and the subsequent inference of properties of remote objects. On the Earth, sensors can be **ground-based**, **aerial** or **orbital**. In astronomy, objects of interest include (in order of proximity) the Sun, planets, stars, exoplanets, supernovae, gravitational waves, black holes, galaxies, the Cosmic Microwave Background. |
| **Return time** | The time it takes for a light pulse to travel to the receiver (**backscatter**) after being reflected from a surface. Useful for measuring the distance to an object. |
| **Revisit** (satellite) | The acquisition of multiple images from the same geolocation during different flybys of the satellite.  |
| **Semantic Segmentation** | An ML task in which each pixel of an image is **classified** into one of many categorical variables, such as belonging to a building or not (building footprint segmentation). |
| **Sensor** | A device designed to measure a physical quantity, like temperature. |

| **Specular reflection** | A mirror reflection of an **EM** wave (with respect to the surface normal). |
| **Super-resolution** | The problem of enhancing the spatial resolution of an image. |
| **Wavelength** | The distance of a full oscillation of an EM wave. It equals the speed of light divided by its frequency. |

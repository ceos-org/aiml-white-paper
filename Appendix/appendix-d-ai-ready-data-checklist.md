# Appendix D. AI Ready data checklist

**Legends**

| Color | Compatibility |
| :---- | :---- |
| White | I can find compatibility with CEOS ARD requirements. |
| Green | I can’t find a definite requirement, but I think it is compatible with other conditions and backgrounds. |
| Yellow | I can find compatibility, but it is “desired”(not minimum requirement). |
| Orange | I can’t find requirements, but I think data providers might show related information to support users' estimates. |
| Red | I can’t find descriptions from CEOS ARD requirements. |

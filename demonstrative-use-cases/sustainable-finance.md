## 5.5. Sustainable Finance

**GOAL :**
Leverage the global coverage of satellite data to develop comprehensive datasets that support sustainable finance initiatives. The financial sector often encounter challenges such as incomplete or missing data, particularly when assessing emissions-intensive industries and assets.

**AI4EO example:**
Use of a variety of advanced deep learning approaches with satellite data to find and characterise cement assets (e.g. [Rossi et al. (2022)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9883772) and [Tkachenko et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02599-w)).

- Example task 1: cement plant assets identified and characterised through CNNs from high resolution multi-spectral satellite data (e.g. Worldview-4).   
- Example task 2: cement plant assets identified and classified through thermal infra-red satellite data.   
- Example task 3: metadata for cement plant assets are searched through LLMs and webscraping.

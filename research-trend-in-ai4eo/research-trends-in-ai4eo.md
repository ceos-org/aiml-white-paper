# 3\. Research trends in AI4EO

The rate of progress in AI4EO is primarily driven by advances in hardware and sensor design first, and then by ML software—research-grade code born out of academic papers that eventually makes it into production-grade **GIS** dev tools. The comoving **SOTA** in ML then translates into new model specifications per use-case. For example a new SOTA in semantic **segmentation** will be immediately translated into a solution for segmenting agricultural parcels. This publication pattern occurs enough times in a year to keep practitioners on their toes. The good news is that the useful set of foundational ideas is extended at least every few years. We covered those in section [**2.2\. Core ideas in Deep Learning**.](/Background/core-ideas-in-deep-learning.md)

## 3.5. AI/ML Tasks and use cases

The table introduces common AI/ML tasks and the representative models used for them.

Table 3.5-1 AI/ML tasks and use cases

| Task | Abstract | Use case | Methods, models |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Classification** | Assigns each pixel or object to a specific class (e.g., forest, water, urban) | Land use/land cover classification (LULC), crop type mapping | Random Forest, SVM, CNN, ResNet, Transformer |
| **Segmentation** | Pixel-level labeling to divide an image into semantic regions | Building extraction, road mapping, flood extent detection | U-Net, DeepLab, SegNet, Mask R-CNN |
| **Object Detection** | Identifies specific objects (e.g., buildings, vehicles) using bounding boxes | Urban monitoring, infrastructure analysis, disaster damage mapping | YOLO, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet |
| **Change Detection** | Detects changes between images taken at different times | Deforestation monitoring, urban growth, disaster impact assessment | Siamese Network, FC-EF, CVAE, STANet |
| **Anormaly Detection** | Identifies unusual or unexpected patterns in imagery | Early warning of wildfires, oil spills, glacier melting | AutoEncoder, Isolation Forest, GAN |
| **Super-resolution** | Enhances low-resolution images to higher resolution | Precision monitoring, SAR image enhancement | SRGAN, ESRGAN, SwinIR |
| **Time Series Analysis** | Analyzes temporal patterns of a location over time | Crop monitoring, drought detection, surface temperature trends | LSTM, TCN, Tfansformer, EarthNet |
| **Spatial Modeling** | Predicts or interpolates spatial distributions | Soil moisture, PM2.5 estimation, rainfall mapping | Kriging+ML, GCN, GeoAI |
| **Data Fusion** | Integrates data from different sensors or resolutions | Multi-sensor analysis (e.g., optical \+ SAR) | CNN+LSTM, Transformer Fusion, DANN |

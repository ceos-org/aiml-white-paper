## 2.1. Overview of Earth Observation[^3]

**Observation** is the process through which mankind is able to collect factual data about their physical surroundings. While **Earth Observation** per se comprises any observation that targets the Earth and anything in on or around it, the most prominent of its sub-domains is probably ‘remote sensing’, of which a significant part is carried out using satellites.  Satellite EO can be thought of as a modern day [‘macroscope’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscope_\(science_concept\)). Whilst traditional microscopes enabled us to study our world at the micro scale, satellite EO is enabling a global-scale view of the Earth and its processes.  
   
The term **remote sensing** refers to the fact that we can observe properties of phenomena from a larger distance usually without any mechanical connection or interaction. It is useful to distinguish this type of observation from those done at smaller, for the observation negligible, distance, which often are referred to as **in-situ**. Any observation requires a signal to carry information about a phenomenon to the sensor. If mechanical interaction (such as in seismics and sonar, which might validly be called remote sensing as well) is neglected here, only two types of signal carriers remain, gravitational and electromagnetic fields.  The by far most used type of signals in remote sensing on which we are hence focussing, are **electromagnetic (EM) waves**.  
   
Electromagnetic waves have an almost unlimited range of wavelengths, called the **Electromagnetic Spectrum** , stretching from atomic to galactic dimensions, part of which is shown in **Figure 2.1-1**. Depending on their wavelength they interact with physical phenomena such as matter at very different scales. Of practical use in remote sensing are wavelengths ranging from some tenth of a micrometre (10\-6m) revealing molecular structure and micro-particles, up to several meters reacting to macroscopic properties like object’s surface roughness or dielectric properties (water content).

Passive optical satellite instruments measure light in the Visible to Infrared parts which arrives either as reflected sun-light or thermally emitted. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites are active , they generate and detect their own signal in the Microwave region.

**Sensors** are key elements of any observation, as they record the signal and  transform it into data. Each sensor thereby inherently takes a ‘snapshot’ of the observed target, which is a **sample** in space, wavelength (spectral or other signal), and time. There is no generally acknowledged **taxonomy of EO sensors** or techniques, but several attributes can be combined to distinguish the most important types in which sensors observe (or sample) phenomena across these dimensions.  
   
In the **spatial dimension** sensors can measure just a single sample, generate 1D coherent profiles, or 2D coherent rasters, being labelled as sounders, profilers, or imagers respectively. Of primary interest to the user is of course the spatial size of the individual sample, also called ‘pixel’. The measured sample size is closely related to the capacity of the sensor to picture the target with a certain detail, often referred to as **spatial resolution**. Spatial resolution is mostly expressed in meters as the size of the pixels which in most cases is roughly identical to their distance.  
   
In EO spatial resolution can range from centimeters to kilometers and is often divided into classes from ‘very high’ (VHR), to ‘high’ (HR), ‘moderate’ (MR), and ’low’ (LR) without internationally applied norms. A relatively detailed and widely used resolution scale is the one used in the Copernicus programme, displayed in **Figure 2.1-2.**

Equally important is the **spectral dimension**, i.e. which part of the electromagnetic spectrum, often called **band** or **channel**, a sensor is sampling and whether it works only with a single band or multiple such bands. Especially in the optical range most sensors are not working with just a single band (‘monospectral’ or ‘monochromatic’), but with a multitude of bands according to which they are called either **multispectral** (‘multiband’) for a few to tens of bands or **hyperspectral** if the number of bands exceeds roughly a hundred. If the bands are spectrally continuous one would also speak of a **(imaging) spectrometer**. The width and distance of the individual spectral band passes also determines the **spectral resolution** of the sensor.  
   
Another primary characteristic of a sensor is whether it just registers a signal received from the target, then called **passive** sensing, or whether it emits that signal to register the response after interaction with the target, defining **active** sensing.  
   
Finally, in the **temporal dimension**, as most observations need to be done repeatedly, the attribute used to characterise sampling is **revisit time,** **repeat frequency,** or **cadence**. If the sensor is mounted on a satellite revisit time is usually very regular and often done such that the local (solar) time of the observation is the same on different days (**sun-synchronous**) in order to maintain observation and target conditions which have diurnal cycles.

The relationship between the spatial resolution and the temporal resolution is plotted for selected satellite missions in Figure 2.1-3.

For AI/ML applications in Earth Observation, it is of paramount importance to understand that most of the desired environmental information cannot be **directly** assessed by EO sensors, which depend primarily on electromagnetic signals. However, spectral, spatial, and temporal variations in these signals contain a wealth of **indirect** information. This can be extracted if there is a physical link between the observed signal and the target variable — such as the relationship between photosynthesis and its characteristic light absorption.  
These links can be exploited using **physical (parametric)** models, which require a detailed understanding of the underlying phenomena, or through **non-parametric, often stochastic** methods such as AI/ML, which rely on sufficient training or reference data. However, the ability to infer information is inherently limited when the desired variable is not — or not reliably — encoded in the observed signals. For example, a sufficiently resolved set of optical and microwave data may enable estimates of tree number, size, density, and condition or even species, but it often does not reveal how the land is being used — whether for forestry, agriculture, or recreation.
